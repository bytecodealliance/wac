## WebAssembly Compositions (WAC)

WAC is a superset of the [WIT language](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md).

However, unlike WIT, WAC is evaluated in a top-down fashion and is not a 
declarative language. Consequently, types must be declared before they are used 
in WAC.

In addition to being able to declare types, interfaces, and worlds, WAC
also allows for defining a _composition_.

In the simplest terms, a composition is a collection of components that
are instantiated in a topological order and certain exports from those
instances are made available as exports of the composition itself.

## Package Directive

Each WAC document must begin with a `package` directive:

```wac
package example:composition;
```

The directive identifies the namespace and name of the package being defined.

Additionally, the `package` directive may include a `targets` clause:

```wac
package example:composition targets wasi:http/proxy;
```

The package path following a `targets` clause must name a world. The parser 
will then ensure that the composition is valid for the given world.

If the composition is not valid for the given world, then an error will be
emitted.

## Statements

WAC currently has three statements that extend the WIT language: import
statements, let statements, and export statements.

### Import Statements

A composition may explicitly import an item with the `import` statement.

Assume a `greeter` interface definition published to a registry:

```wit
package example:greeter;

interface greeter {
  greet: func() -> string;
}
```

If we want to import an _instance_ of this interface in our composition, we can
use the `import` statement in WAC:

```wac
import greeter: example:greeter/greeter;
```

Items imported by a package path use the path as the name of the import in the
resulting composition; in the above example, the import name would be
`example:greeter/greeter`.

The `as` keyword can be used to rename the imported item:

```wac
import greeter as my-greeter: example:greeter/greeter;
```

Here the name of the import becomes `my-greeter`; the name may be any valid
import name in the component model.

The local name `greeter` can then be used to refer to the imported item from
the rest of the composition.

Imports may also use inline interface and function type declarations:

```wac
import greeter: interface {
    greet: func() -> string;
};

import greet: func() -> string;
```

As these imports are not by package path, the name of the import will be the
same as the local name, by default. In the above example, this would be
`greeter` and `greet`, respectively. As previously mentioned, the `as` keyword
can be used to specify a different import name.

#### Implicit Imports

While the `import` statement is used to define an _explicit_ import, the `new`
expression (covered below) can be used to _implicitly_ import items from the
composition.

A special syntax of the `new` expression allows for omitting instantiation
arguments in favor of simply importing the arguments directly from the
composition and passing them through to the instantiation.

Let's assume there exists a component named `example:my-component` with the
following world (i.e. component type):

```wit
world my-component {
    import i: interface {
        f: func();
    };
}
```

We can instantiate this component using the `new` expression without having to
explicitly specify the `i` argument:

```wac
let my-instance = new example:my-component { ... };
```

The special `...` syntax indicates that any arguments that were not specified
as part of the `new` expression should be imported from the composition and
passed through to the instantiation. The `...` syntax must be used as the last
argument to the `new` expression.

The above is equivalent to:

```wac
import i: interface {
    f: func();
};

let my-instance = new example:my-component { i };
```

Note that implicit imports may not conflict with explicit imports of the same
name.

Additionally, the WAC parser will attempt to merge implicit imports; if a merge
cannot be performed, an error will be emitted about the conflicting definitions.

Let's assume there exists an `example:my-other-component` with the following
world:

```wit
world my-other-component {
    import i: interface {
        g: func() -> string;
    };
}
```

If we attempt to instantiate both `example:my-component` and
`example:my-other-component` using implicit imports:

```wac
let my-instance = new example:my-component { ... };
let my-other-instance = new example:my-other-component { ... };
```

Then the parser will _merge_ the two implicit imports of `i` together,
resulting in the following equivalent composition:

```wac
import i: interface {
    f: func();
    g: func() -> string;
};

let my-instance = new example:my-component { i };
let my-other-instance = new example:my-other-component { i };
```

As seen above, items that are implicitly imported are _shared_ between any
instantiations that refer to them.

### Let Statements

The `let` statement allows for binding a local name in the composition to the
result of an expression.

Note that local names are not variables and cannot be reassigned; a
redefinition of a previous name is an error.

There are currently five expressions in WAC:

* A local name (e.g. `a`), resulting in the value of the name.
* The `new` expression (e.g `new a:b { }`)
* The postfix access expression (e.g. `a.b`).
* The postfix named access expression (e.g. `a["b"]`)
* The nested expression (e.g. `(<expr>)`).

#### New Expressions

A `new` expression instantiates a component and returns a component instance
representing its _exports_.

The `new` expression takes the name of the package (i.e. component) to
instantiate and a list of instantiation arguments (i.e. imports).

The last argument may be the special `...` argument that implies any missing
arguments should be imported from the composition and implicitly passed as
arguments to the instantiation.

If `...` is not specified, then all instantiation arguments must be explicitly
specified.

There are three forms of instantiation arguments: inferred arguments,
named arguments, and spread arguments.

##### Inferred Arguments

An inferred argument is passed directly by local name:

```wac
let i = new a:b { c };
```

Where `i` is the name of the bound instance, `a:b` is the package being
instantiated, and the local name `c` is the instantiation argument.

The name of the instantiation argument is inferred according to these rules (in
order of precedence):

* If the local name is bound to an instance with an associated package path (
e.g. `foo:bar/baz`) and the component being instantiated has an import with a
matching path, then the path will be used as the argument name.

* If the local name is bound to an explicit import or an access of an instance
export and the component being instantiated has an import with a matching name,
then the import/export name will be used as the argument name.

* If the component being instantiated has exactly one import that has a path
which ends with the local name (e.g. `foo:bar/c`), then the path will be used
as the argument name.

* Lastly, the local name will be used as the argument name.

##### Named Arguments

Named arguments provide the name of the instantiation argument to use:

```wac
let i = new a:b { c: d };
```

Where `i` is the name of the bound instance, `a:b` is the package being
instantiated, `c` is the name of the instantiation argument, and `d` is the
value of the argument.

The name may be specified as a kebab-case identifier (e.g. `foo-bar`) or as a
string (e.g. `"foo-bar"`).

When using a kebab-case identifier, a special rule is used to determine the
actual name of the argument:

* If the component being instantiated has exactly one import that has a path
which ends with the local name (e.g. `foo:bar/foo-bar`), then the path will be
used as the argument name.

* Otherwise, the kebab-case identifier will be used as the argument name.

With this rule, the following example is valid:

```wac
let stream = new my:stream {};

// Assumption: `a:b` has an import with path `wasi:io/input-stream`
let i = new a:b { input-stream: stream };
```

##### Spread Arguments

Spread arguments allow for specifying the _exports of an instance_ as arguments
to the instantiation of a component.

Like the `...` syntax for implicit imports, a `...` precedes a local name as an
indication to spread the instance's exports as arguments to the instantiation:

```wac
let i = new a:b { ...c };
```

Where `i` is the name of the bound instance, `a:b` is the package being
instantiated and `c` is the local name of an instance.

It in an error for the local name used in a spread argument to name anything
other than an instance.

With this syntax, the exports of the instance `c` will be spread to any
_unspecified_ and _unsatisfied_ instantiation arguments.

Note that spread arguments apply _after_ inferred and named arguments and are
applied _in-order_; this means that the order of spread arguments is important:

```
let i = new a:b { foo: bar, ...c, baz, ...d };
```

In the above example, arguments `foo` and `baz` will bind to the instantiation
arguments of `a:b` first.

Any unsatisfied arguments will then be satisfied by the matching exports of
instance `c`, followed by any matching the exports of instance `d`.

The above behavior differs from JavaScript's spread argument syntax, which is
the inspiration for this syntax, because component instantiation arguments are
_named_ and not _positional_.

Additionally, it is an evaluation error if a spread argument has no matching
exports.

#### Access Expressions

The postfix access expression allows for accessing an export of an instance.

An example of instantiating component `a:b` and then binding the `wasi:io/outgoing-stream`
export of the instance to `s`.

```wac
let i = new a:b { ... };
let s = i.outgoing-stream;
``````

Taking the above example into consideration, access expressions use the
following rules to determine the name of the export:

* If component `a:b` has exactly one export with `outgoing-stream` as the final
component of a path (e.g. `wasi:io/outgoing-stream`), then the path will be
used as the export name.

* Otherwise, `outgoing-stream` will be used as the export name.

It is invalid to use an access expression on anything other than an instance.

#### Named Access Expressions

Similar to the postfix access expression, the postfix named access expression
is used to access an export of an instance.

However, this form allows for the export name to be explicitly specified as a
string:

```wac
let i = new a:b { ... };
let s = i["wasi:io/outgoing-stream"];
```

This is equivalent to the previous example except that the export name is
_exactly_ what is specified by the string; no inference is performed.

The string may be any legal export name in the component model.

It is invalid to use a named access expression on anything other than an
instance.

#### Transform Expressions
TODO

### Export Statements

Export statements are used to export the result of an expression from the
composition itself:

```wac
let my-run = new a:b { ... }.run;
export my-run;

// note: this is also equivalent to:
// export new a:b { ... }.run;
```

In the above example, component `a:b` is instantiated and the local name
`my-run` is bound to the export of `run` from the instance, which we can assume
in this example to be a function of type `func()`.

The `export` statement is then used to export the `my-run` function from the
composition using the export name `run` as that is the name that was accessed
from the instance.

The `as` keyword can be used to rename the export:

```wac
let my-run = new a:b { ... }.run;
export my-run as "my-run";
```

Like spread arguments in `new` expressions, exports of an instance may be
_spread_ as exports of the composition:

```wac
let my-instance = new a:b { ... };
export my-instance...;
```

If we assume that component `a:b` in the above example has the following world:

```wit
interface setup {
    setup: func(config: string);
}

world a:b {
    export run: func();
    export setup: setup;
}
```

Then the composition will export a `run` function of type `func()` and an
instance with name `a:b/setup`.

It is an evaluation error if the instance being spread has no exports; it is a
syntax error to use an `as` clause with a spread export.

Spread exports will only create new exports that do not conflict with
previously exported items.

If we extend the above example to be:

```wac
let my-instance = new a:b { ... };
let run = b:c { ... }.run;
export run;
export my-instance...;
```

Then the `run` function exported by the composition will be from the instance
named `b:c` and not the instance named `a:b`.
